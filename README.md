# Blog Website

This project is a simple, responsive blog website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a navigation menu, three sample blog posts, a comment section, and basic styling.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: A simple menu to navigate through sections.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures proper display on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Blog Posts**: Three example blogs, each containing a title, content, publication date, and an associated image.
- **Comment Section**: Allows users to submit comments that dynamically appear on the page.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: Provides the styling for the website.
- `script.js`: Adds interactivity, particularly for the comment section.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern web browser installed to view and test the website.

### Installation

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Place the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files in the same directory.
3. Add the blog images (`blog1.jpg`, `blog2.jpg`, `blog3.jpg`) to the project directory.

### Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Navigate through the website using the menu.
3. Read the sample blog posts.
4. Add comments using the form in the Comments section.

## Customization

- **Adding Blogs**: Add more blog posts by copying the structure of an existing `<article>` in the HTML.
- **Styling**: Modify `styles.css` to change the look and feel of the website.
- **Script**: Extend `script.js` for additional functionality, such as comment moderation or persistent storage.

## Known Issues

- Comments are not saved after refreshing the page. To add persistence, consider integrating a backend or using local storage.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a backend for saving blog posts and comments.
- Include advanced features like search functionality or category filtering.
- Improve accessibility for better user experience.
